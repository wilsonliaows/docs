# MySQL - Select actions

## Select rows
This action lets you select rows based on certain criteria defined by a ` WHERE` condition. Rows from the selected table that match the `WHERE` condition will be returned as output of this action.

### Table
First, select a table to work with. This can be done either by selecting a table from the pick list, or toggle the input to text mode and type the full table name.

### WHERE condition
Next, provide a `WHERE` condition to filter rows. This condition can be as simple as filtering a single record by it's `ID`.

```sql
id = 123
```

Alternatively, it can be used to select multiple rows based on values in one or more columns.

```sql
status = 'closed' and priority = 1
```

Complex `WHERE` conditions with subqueries can also be used. Refer to the [WHERE condition](/connectors/mysql.md#where-condition) guide for more information.

### Order by
Rows returned from this action can be ordered based on the **Order by** input field. This field is used to change the default ordering of rows from your MySQL database. You can also define the direction of order for each column you wish to order by. The following order by statement will order rows by `priority` in ascending order followed by `created_date` in descending order (latest first).

```sql
priority asc, created_date desc
```

### Limit
This input field determines the maximum number of rows to return. The default limit is 100 and capped at a maximum of 1000 rows for a single **Select rows** action.

### Offset
This input field gives you the option to fetch only a page of results from the entire results set. For example, to skip the first 100 rows of the selected results set, input `100` to this field. Default is `0`.
