# Quick Base action - Create and update records in bulk from CSV file
![Quick Base's action: Create and update records in bulk from CSV file](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/action-import-csv.png)

## How it works
This action takes a CSV file then create or update Quick Base records in bulk. The way it works depends on your Quick Base table configuration:

### If your Quick Base table uses default key field - Record ID
![Quick Base Default Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/qb-default-record-id.png)

Default key field `Record ID#` is automatically generated by Quick Base. In this case, you can choose to do one of the followings:
- Create new records only
- Create & update records using default key field
- Create & update records using custom merge field

#### Create new records only
First, in Workato's `Quick Base table settings`, select `Key field` to be the default `Record ID`.

![Key field - default](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/key-field-default.png)

Since default `Record ID#` is auto-generated, you do not need to provide it when creating new records. Just leave the first field `Record ID#` in the `Column mappings` section **blank**:

![Blank Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-record-id-blank.png)

#### Create & update records using default key field
You may want to use the default key field `Record ID#` to create & update Quick Base records at the same time.

First you need to include a column containing Quick Base record ID in your CSV file.

![Record ID column in CSV file](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-record-id.png)

Then in Workato's `Quick Base table settings`, select `Key field` to be the default `Record ID`.

![Key field - custom](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/key-field-default.png)

Then in the `Column mappings` section, map your table's `Record ID#` column with the record ID column in your CSV file.

![Mapped Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-record-id-mapped.png)

Based on the provided record IDs from the CSV file, Quick Base will decide whether to create or update records. The rule is that for each CSV row:
- If record ID is empty, `create` a new Quick Base record.
- If record ID is present, search for the matching record ID in Quick Base then `update` that record. If no matching record ID is found in Quick Base, that CSV row will `fail`.

#### Create & update records using custom merge field
You may want to use an unique custom merge field like `Order ID` to create & update records, instead of the default key field `Record ID#`. In this case, `Order ID` will be used to determine if a CSV record already exists in Quick Base.

First, you need to have `Order ID` column in your CSV file.

![Custom ID column in CSV file](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-custom-id.png)

Then in Workato's `Quick Base table settings`, select `Use custom merge field`, then select `Order ID` column in your Quick Base table.

![Custom merge field](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/merge-field.png)

Then in the `Column mappings` section, map your table's `Order ID` column with your CSV file's `Order ID` column.

![Custom Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-custom-id-mapped.png)

Based on the provided IDs from the CSV file, Quick Base will decide whether to create or update records. The rule is that for each CSV row:
- If ID is empty or doesn't exist in Quick Base, `create` a new Quick Base record.
- If ID is present and exists in Quick Base, `update` that record.

### If your Quick Base table uses custom key field
![Quick Base Custom Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/qb-custom-record-id.png)

In the example above, this Quick Base table uses `Order ID` as the custom key field, instead of the default `Record ID#`. In this case, you can choose to do one of the followings:
- Create & update records using custom key field
- Update records using custom merge field

#### Create & update records using custom key field
Custom key field is not automatically generated by Quick Base, so you always need to provide it as a column in your CSV file. In this case, `Order ID`.

![Custom ID column in CSV file](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-custom-id.png)

In Workato's `Quick Base table settings`, select `Key field` to be `Order ID`.

![Key field - default](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/key-field-custom.png)

Then map the first field in `Column mappings` section with the appropriate key field in your CSV file.

![Custom Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-custom-id-mapped.png)

Based on the provided IDs from the CSV file, Quick Base will decide whether to create or update records. The rule is that for each CSV row:
- If ID is present, search for the matching record ID in Quick Base then `update` that record. If no matching ID is found in Quick Base, `create` a new Quick Base record with that ID.
- If ID is empty, that CSV row will `fail`.

#### Update records using custom merge field
You may want to use an unique custom merge field like `Item Type` to update records, instead of using the key field `Order ID`. In this case, `Item Type` will be used to determine if a CSV record already exists in Quick Base.

In Workato's `Quick Base table settings`, select `Use custom merge field`, and then `Item Type`

![Custom merge field](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/merge-field-custom.png)

Then map the first field in `Column mappings` section with the appropriate field in your CSV file.

![Custom Record ID](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-custom-merge-field-map.png)

Based on the provided IDs from the CSV file, Quick Base will update the records. The rule is that for each CSV row:
- If ID is present, search for the matching record ID in Quick Base then `update` that record. If no matching ID is found in Quick Base, that CSV row will `fail`
- If ID is empty, that CSV row will `fail`.

### Handling failed CSV rows
This action uses [batch processing](https://docs.workato.com/features/batch-processing.html), so it will divide your CSV file into smaller chunks of rows (or batches) then submit to Quick Base. When 1 row in a chunk failed to be created/updated into Quick Base records, Quick Base will reject that whole chunk, but other chunks will not be affected.

When some rows fail, however, the action may still be considered "complete". It is because Quick Base has successfully accepted the CSV file. Quick Base API will then send back a "success" response with list of successful and failed records.

In this example, the job report shows "Complete" status. However, when we check the action output, there is actually 1 failed chunk.
![Job complete](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-job-complete.png)

![Chunk error](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-import-chunk-error.png)

It is thus important to always handle failed CSV rows in your recipe. The output pill `CSV contents of failed records` contains all failed CSV rows. You can use this to save the failed rows into a CSV file. Then check the job report for error reason, fix those failed rows and use this action to re-import them later.

Here is [a sample recipe](https://preview.workato.com/recipes/25445#recipe) in which we saved the failed rows into a CSV file in Box. You can save the CSV file into other file storage systems, using connectors such as Amazon S3, SFTP, On-premises file, etc.

## Input fields
For this action to work, you need to configure these 4 sections:
1. Quick Base table
2. CSV file input
3. Column mappings
4. Advanced settings

### Quick Base table
![Quick Base table settings](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/input-quick-base-table.png)

Configure what Quick Base table you want to import the data to.

Pay attention to the field `Key field`. It is important to select the correct column that represents Quick Base key field in your table. This ID needs to be unique for each record. Workato uses this field to search for and update the correct record. You can also switch to `Use custom merge field`.

By default, Quick Base uses a field named `Record ID`. But in some cases, you may use custom column as record ID, for example `Sales Order ID`, `Customer ID`, etc.

### CSV file input
![CSV file input](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/input-CSV.png)

Provide the contents of your CSV file and describe the column structure.

You can get `File contents` data pill from [other connectors' actions or triggers](https://docs.workato.com/features/handling-csv-files.html). Some examples include: `New CSV file in folder` trigger from file connectors (such as [Box](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/box.html), [Amazon S3](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/s3.html), [On-premises file](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/on-prem-files.html)); or Workato Utility's `Compose CSV` action.

Note that the file contents must be **comma-separated and UTF-8 format**.

### Column mappings
![Quick Base - CSV column mappings](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/input-CSV-column-mappings.png)

This section lists down all columns in your Quick Base table. You need to map them with the respective columns in your CSV file.

Pay attention to the first input field, `Record ID`. Make sure to map it with the correct record ID column in your CSV file, so Workato can use that to search for and update records in Quick Base. In this sample CSV file, we use column `Quick Base Record ID`:

![Record ID in CSV file](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-record-id.png)

### Advanced settings
![Chunk size](/assets/images/connectors/quick-base/csv-advanced-settings.png)

Since this action uses [batch processing](https://docs.workato.com/features/batch-processing.html), it divides your CSV file into smaller chunks of rows to submit to Quick Base. This allows you to submit a large CSV file without hitting Quick Base API limit.

Using this `Chunk size (KB)`, you can customise the chunk size (in kilobytes) to your need. In general, larger chunk size will shorten the time to transfer a large file.

## Output
