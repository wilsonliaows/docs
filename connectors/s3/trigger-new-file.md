# Amazon S3 trigger - New file
Triggers when a new file is added in a selected bucket/folder in Amazon S3.

Checks selected folder for new file every 1 minutes. The output includes the file’s metadata and file contents. The file contents is returned as a [streaming object](https://docs.workato.com/features/file-streaming.html) and can handle unlimited file size.

Note that in Amazon S3, when a file is renamed, it is considered a new file. When a file is uploaded and overwrites an existing file with the same name, it is considered an updated file but not a new file.

## Input fields
| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | When recipe starts for the first time, it will pick up files created from this specified time. Once recipe has been run or tested, value cannot be changed. [Learn more about this field here](https://docs.workato.com/recipes/triggers.html#sincefrom).  |
| Bucket region | The region of the bucket to monitor for new file, e.g. us-west-2. In Amazon S3, go to **Bucket > Properties > Static website hosting** to find your region in the Endpoint URL. |
| Bucket | The bucket to monitor for new file. Select a bucket from the picklist or enter the bucket name directly. |
| Folder | The folder to monitor for new file. Select a folder from the picklist or enter the folder path directly. |
| Include sub-folders | If set to `Yes`, sub-folders will also be monitored for new file. |
| Chunk size (in kilobytes) | File contents will be [streamed](https://docs.workato.com/features/file-streaming.html) in chunks of this size. Default is 1024 KB, minimum is 32 KB. By default, Workato automatically manages the chunk size. Configure this when you want to optimize the data throughput yourself. Larger chunk size will increase throughput, but may exceed API limit. |

This trigger supports [Trigger Condition](https://docs.workato.com/recipes/triggers.html#trigger-conditions), which allows you to filter trigger events.
