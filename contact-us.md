# Bug reports
If you encounter bugs while building recipes, or if your triggers and actions are behaving unexpectedly, you can [submit a ticket](https://support.workato.com/support/tickets/new) and our team will look into it.

If you are looking for recipe building and troubleshooting support, this is the information we need:
- Connector
- Trigger/action
- Recipe ID
- Job ID
- Error ID and error message
- Recipe URL (e.g. https://www.workato.com/recipes/7943)
- Screenshots of the problem/job report are recommended to provide more context

To provide swifter troubleshooting, you can grant our support team administrative access to your account via the ticket submission portal.
